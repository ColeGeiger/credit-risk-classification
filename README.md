Credit Risk Analysis Report

Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model trained on lending data. The model's goal is to predict the credit risk associated with loan applications, classifying them as either healthy loans (0) or high-risk loans (1). By accurately identifying high-risk loans, financial institutions can mitigate potential losses, thereby enhancing their loan approval process and overall financial health.


Model Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model across both classes. It's the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
- Precision (Healthy Loans): Indicates the model's accuracy in predicting healthy loans. It reflects the proportion of true positive predictions in all positive predictions for the healthy loan class.
- Precision (High-Risk Loans): Reflects the model's accuracy in identifying high-risk loans. It shows how many of the loans predicted as high-risk were actually high-risk.
- Recall (Healthy Loans): Measures the model's ability to capture all actual healthy loans. It's the ratio of correctly predicted healthy loans to all actual healthy loans.
- Recall (High-Risk Loans): Indicates how well the model identifies all actual high-risk loans. It's the ratio of correctly predicted high-risk loans to all actual high-risk loans.

Summary and Recommendation
The logistic regression model, particularly after applying oversampling techniques to address class imbalance, demonstrates promising results in credit risk prediction:

- The model achieves a high balanced accuracy score, indicating effective performance in distinguishing between healthy and high-risk loans.
- Precision and recall scores for both classes are significantly improved with the oversampled data, ensuring that the model is both reliable in its predictions and capable of identifying the majority of high-risk loans without excessively misclassifying healthy loans as high-risk.


Based on these findings, the model is recommended for use by the company in its loan approval process. Its ability to accurately predict high-risk loans can help the company reduce the risk of default, leading to better financial outcomes. However, continuous monitoring and model updates are advised to maintain its performance over time, considering changes in economic conditions and borrower behaviors.
